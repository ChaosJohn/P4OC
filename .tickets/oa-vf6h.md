# Resource todo tracker status and progress labels

Problem:
Todo/progress labels are generated as hardcoded English UI strings instead of resource-backed presentation text.

Evidence:
Domain/display audit identified TodoTracker.kt status labels and progress strings as user-facing copy outside a clear UI resource boundary.

UX Constraint:
Todo/progress text should be clear in compact chat/workspace UI and localizable. Status indicators must use the app-wide status language where possible and avoid fake precision or misleading progress.

Expected Behavior:
Todo tracker data exposes structured status/progress facts. UI formatting maps those facts to resource-backed labels and concise accessible descriptions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Separate todo/progress state from user-facing label strings.
- Move todo status/progress labels to resources or a UI formatter using resources.
- Align status wording with the app-wide status dot semantics where applicable.
- Add tests for status/progress formatting that do not depend on domain hardcoded English.
- Preserve meaningful accessibility/content descriptions for functional indicators.

Verification:
Run targeted todo tracker/UI formatter tests and compile after implementation.
