# Make saved server removal safe

## Problem

`ServerScreen` renders destructive saved-server removal as inline raw text: `remove` or `warn remove`. Tapping it immediately removes the saved server. When open tabs reference that server, `warn remove` looks like a status label rather than a destructive action, and it does not explain what happens to those tabs.

This violates the project UI rule that row-specific actions belong in long-press or overflow menus and creates data-loss/footgun risk.

## Evidence

- `app/src/main/java/dev/blazelight/p4oc/ui/screens/server/ServerScreen.kt` currently renders `text = if (server.endpointKey in openTabEndpointKeys) "warn remove" else "remove"` in the saved server row.
- `local-adb-screenshots/oa-5sro-visual-qa/17_server_removal_open_tabs_warning.png` shows `warn remove` inline next to `Remote Server`.
- AGENTS.md Agent-Space UI Rule prefers row-specific actions in long-press or overflow menus, not persistent inline destructive text.
- The same screen already has open-tab endpoint awareness; use that count to explain consequences before removal.

## UX Constraint

Row tap should select/connect to a server. Destructive actions must be secondary, explicit, localized, and confirmed when open tabs are affected.

## Expected Behavior

Saved server rows expose an overflow action affordance with accessible semantics. The destructive item is named `Forget server`, appears last, and opens a confirmation dialog when open tabs reference that server.
- Keep server row tap reserved for connect/select. Do not overload it with destructive management.
- Follow Agent-Space UI Rule: row-specific actions should be contextual/overflow, not always-visible inline chrome.

Open-tab confirmation copy should explain the consequence, for example:

`1 open tab is using this server. Existing tabs will stay open until closed or reconnected, but this server will be removed from saved targets.`

## Acceptance Criteria

- Inline `remove` / `warn remove` text is gone from saved server rows.
- Saved server rows have an overflow/menu action with a content description and test tag.
- The overflow menu includes `Forget server` as a destructive action.
- Forgetting a saved server with open tabs shows a confirmation dialog with the open-tab count and consequence.
- Forgetting a saved server without open tabs is still explicit and not triggered by tapping the row body.
- Visible strings are localized in `strings.xml`.
- Key interactions have content descriptions/test tags.
- Compile and detekt pass.

## Failure States To Avoid

- Do not silently delete a saved server from a warning-colored inline label.
- Do not imply open tabs will be closed if they will remain open, or imply they remain safe if removal will break reconnect.
- Do not leave `warn remove` or `remove` as raw visible strings in code.
- Do not move the destructive action into the row body tap target.

## Verification

- Capture or inspect the saved server row: no inline `warn remove` should appear.
- With an open tab for a server, choose Forget server and verify confirmation appears before removal.
- Run `JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk ./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin && JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk ./gradlew :app:detekt`.

## Verification Notes

- 2026-07-09: Implementation changed saved server rows from inline `remove` / `warn remove` text to an overflow menu with localized `Forget server` and a destructive `TuiConfirmDialog` that includes open-tab count when applicable.
- 2026-07-09: `JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk ./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin && JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk ./gradlew :app:detekt` passed.
- 2026-07-09: Device verification is still required before closing. `JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk ./gradlew :app:installDebug` failed with `No connected devices`, and `adb devices` returned no connected device. Do not close until the overflow -> Forget server -> confirmation dialog flow is screenshotted with an open tab referencing the saved server.
