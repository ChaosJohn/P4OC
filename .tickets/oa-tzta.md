# Restore file explorer path search and symbol filters per tab

Problem:
File explorer navigation and filter state can be lost or leak across tabs/workspaces because path/search/symbol state is lifecycle-blind or not clearly scoped.

Evidence:
Lifecycle audit identified FilesViewModel.kt and FileExplorerScreen.kt path stack, search query, symbol filters, and related file navigation state as restoration-critical.

UX Constraint:
File navigation state helps prevent wrong-directory mistakes. It should be preserved enough to resume work without taking extra persistent chrome space.

Expected Behavior:
Each file tab/workspace restores its current path, search query, and symbol/filter state when returning. State is isolated between workspaces/tabs and clears only through explicit user action or clear UX policy.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Scope explorer path/search/symbol filter state by workspace/tab.
- Persist or save state across tab switches and configuration changes.
- Ensure a different workspace/tab does not inherit another explorer's path/search/filter state.
- Add tests for same-tab restoration and cross-tab/workspace isolation.
- Show human-readable error if restored path no longer exists, with a safe fallback to workspace root.

Verification:
Run targeted FilesViewModel/FileExplorer tests and smoke test two workspaces/tabs with different explorer paths.
