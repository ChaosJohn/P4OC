# Make workspace-scoped session search explicit

Problem:
Session search can still treat null directory as global/all-project search, which can cross workspace boundaries and reintroduce old wrong-directory bugs.

Evidence:
Workspace audit found SessionRepositoryImpl.searchSessions(query, directory: String? = null) treating null as global plus every project worktree, scoped SessionRepositoryImpl.hydrate() still loading global and all project sessions, and tests encoding broad null-directory search.

UX Constraint:
Users must trust that session search results belong to the active workspace unless they explicitly choose server-global search. Workspace identity should remain compact but clear enough to prevent mistakes.

Expected Behavior:
Workspace-scoped search searches only the current workspace directory. Server-global/all-workspace search is a separate explicit action/type/name and is labeled in UI. Omitted directory parameters cannot silently broaden scope.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Remove nullable default arguments that let callers omit search workspace identity.
- Split workspace-scoped search from explicit server-global/all-project search in API/repository names or types.
- Ensure scoped hydrate/search only returns current workspace sessions unless explicitly global.
- Update tests that currently assert broad null-directory search.
- Add regression test with two workspace directories proving scoped search isolation.
- Add UI copy or result labeling for explicit global search if exposed.

Verification:
Run targeted SessionRepositoryImpl/session list tests and smoke test search in two workspace tabs.


## Notes

Clarification from 2026-07-05 workspace/tab UX discussion:

Coordinate this ticket with oa-e6g3. The agreed flat-tab UX is: a fresh top-level Sessions tab is intentionally WorkspaceKey.Global and should show all sessions/top-down view. Workspace-scoped search is still required for contextual/session/project views, but Global is not inherently a bug when it is explicit.

Implementation intent:
- Replace omitted nullable directory defaults with explicit WorkspaceKey input.
- WorkspaceKey.Global search/hydrate means intentional server-wide/all-sessions behavior, appropriate for fresh top-level Sessions.
- WorkspaceKey.Directory(path) search/hydrate means scoped project/session behavior, appropriate for contextual opens.
- Missing legacy workspaceKey = null is not Global; it should recover/ask rather than silently fan out.

Do not implement this by making every Sessions tab directory-scoped. The bug is global fan-out by omission/ambiguous null, not explicit top-level Global behavior.
