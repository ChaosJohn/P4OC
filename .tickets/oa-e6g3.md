# Require explicit workspace when creating tabs

Problem:
Tab creation APIs can create global/null-workspace tabs by omission, making workspace identity ambiguous and risking old global-directory behavior.

Evidence:
Workspace/default audit found createTab(... workspaceDirectory: String? = null) and TabState default workspaceDirectory = null. Server-global behavior may be valid, but omission should not be indistinguishable from an intentional server-global tab.

UX Constraint:
Workspace/project identity should be visible enough to prevent wrong-directory mistakes, without adding unnecessary persistent chrome. Creation flows should not silently default to global workspace.

Expected Behavior:
Creating a chat/file/terminal/session tab requires an explicit workspace choice or an explicit server-global choice. Persisted TabState distinguishes intentional global workspace from missing/legacy workspace data.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Remove or replace nullable default workspaceDirectory arguments from tab creation APIs.
- Introduce an explicit workspace scope representation for workspace directory versus intentional server-global.
- Handle legacy persisted tabs without guessing: show explicit mismatch/recovery where needed.
- Add tests proving tab creation callers must pass workspace scope.
- Add tests proving intentional server-global tabs are represented distinctly from missing workspace state.

Verification:
Run targeted TabManager/TabState route persistence tests and compile. Smoke test creating tabs from a selected workspace.

Design correction from 2026-07-05 discussion:

Do NOT introduce a new WorkspaceScope/TabWorkspace sealed hierarchy. The project already has the explicit workspace identity type: domain/server/WorkspaceKey.kt with Directory(value), Global, and SessionScoped(sessionId). Existing Workspace(server, directory) derives Workspace.key, so the fix is to stop storing raw nullable String? workspaceDirectory in TabState and start storing WorkspaceKey? directly.

Target model:
- TabState should hold workspaceKey: WorkspaceKey? instead of workspaceDirectory: String?.
- WorkspaceKey.Directory(path) means explicit project/workspace context.
- WorkspaceKey.Global means intentional server-global/top-down context.
- WorkspaceKey.SessionScoped(sessionId) may be valid for session/event/cache contexts, but must be resolved or rejected before directory-required operations.
- null means missing legacy/ambiguous workspace identity that needs recovery; null does NOT mean Global.

Three-bucket UX/callsite model:
1. Fresh top-level tab/menu creation = Global/top-down view.
   - Tabs are flat, not hierarchical. A fresh Sessions tab should show all sessions/server-wide, not inherit the active tab's workspace.
   - MainTabScreen.kt:350-352 currently passes activeWorkspaceDirectory to new Sessions tab; this should change to explicit WorkspaceKey.Global.
   - MainTabScreen.kt:394-396 top-level terminal creation currently passes activeWorkspaceDirectory; it must stop implicitly inheriting. Use explicit WorkspaceKey.Global if terminal-from-menu is meant to be server default, or add an explicit workspace/server choice if product decides terminal cannot safely be global. Do not inherit by omission.
2. Contextual opens from an existing workspace/session/file keep context.
   - MainTabScreen.kt:498-500 terminal opened from a specific tab should keep that tab's explicit WorkspaceKey.
   - MainTabScreen.kt:541-543 files tab opened for a selected/open workspace should keep the selected explicit Directory key, or explicit Global only if the user chose server-global files.
   - TabNavHost.kt:343-345 sub-session chat opened from current chat should keep workspaceOwner.workspace.key.
3. Legacy/ambiguous restored workspace-critical tabs recover instead of guessing.
   - Persisted nonblank old workspaceDirectory migrates to WorkspaceKey.Directory(value).
   - Known top-level/global-safe routes may migrate to WorkspaceKey.Global.
   - Workspace-critical legacy routes with null/missing workspace become workspaceKey = null and show a recovery state asking the user to choose context; do not silently convert them to Global.

Acceptance addendum:
- TabManager.createTab requires WorkspaceKey for new calls; no default nullable workspaceDirectory arg.
- TabState persistence distinguishes explicit Global from missing legacy null.
- Tests must prove fresh top-level Sessions creation uses Global, contextual opens preserve Directory, and legacy missing workspace does not become Global.
- API/repository boundary conversion remains: Directory -> directory string, Global -> null, SessionScoped -> resolve/reject depending endpoint.

Decision pause from 2026-07-06:

Before implementing the WorkspaceKey migration, we paused because the change affects tab bar plus-button semantics. Tester added red contract tests in TabManagerPersistenceTest targeting the desired WorkspaceKey API, but production has not been changed yet.

Brainstorm consensus:
- The architecture should eventually distinguish WorkspaceKey.Directory, WorkspaceKey.Global, WorkspaceKey.SessionScoped, and legacy/missing ambiguity.
- The plus button is a product-intent question, not just a storage refactor.
- Preserving current/mobile UX likely means plus-created Sessions and Terminal should inherit the active tab's explicit workspace key, while Files should keep a chooser; contextual opens should inherit source context.
- Avoid a mechanical migration that turns plus actions into always-Global unless that product behavior is explicitly chosen.

Recommended next decision before implementation: choose between full WorkspaceKey cutover with plus-button inheritance preserved, a smaller createTab guardrail, or deferring oa-e6g3 for another narrower P1.

**2026-07-06T12:52:16Z**

Blocked on oa-qv8d. Do not resume implementation until plus-button workspace semantics are decided and recorded; current red tests target a possible API but production migration is intentionally paused.

**2026-07-06T12:54:34Z**

Follow-up cleanup: removed the compile-red speculative WorkspaceKey contract tests from TabManagerPersistenceTest while oa-e6g3 is blocked on oa-qv8d. Left existing persistence tests compiling against current production API. Verified with ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests dev.blazelight.p4oc.ui.tabs.TabManagerPersistenceTest.
